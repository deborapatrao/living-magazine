              Nudibranchs are a group of soft-bodied, marine gastropod molluscs
              which shed their shells after their larval stage. They are noted
              for their often extraordinary colours and striking forms, and they
              have been given colourful nicknames to match, such as "clown",
              "marigold", "splendid", "dancer", "dragon", or "sea rabbit".
              Currently, about 3,000 valid species of nudibranchs are known.
            </p>

            <p>
              The word "nudibranch" comes from the Latin nudus "naked" and the
              Ancient Greek βράγχια (bránkhia) "gills".
            </p>

            <p>
              Nudibranchs are often casually called sea slugs, as they are a
              family of opistobranchs (sea slugs), within the phylum Mollusca
              (molluscs), but many sea slugs belong to several taxonomic groups
              which are not closely related to nudibranchs. A number of these
              other sea slugs, such as the photosynthetic Sacoglossa and the
              colourful Aglajidae, are often confused with nudibranchs.

            <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
            <p>
              Nudibranchs occur in seas worldwide, ranging from the Arctic,
              through temperate and tropical regions, to the Southern Ocean
              around Antarctica. They are almost entirely restricted to salt
              water, although a few species are known to inhabit lower
              salinities in brackish water.
            </p>

            <h2>Anatomical description</h2>

            <p>
              The body forms of nudibranchs vary a great deal, but because they
              are opisthobranchs, unlike most other gastropods, they are
              apparently bilaterally symmetrical externally (but not internally)
              because they have undergone secondary detorsion. In all
              nudibranchs, the male and female sexual openings are on the right
              side of the body, reflecting their asymmetrical origins. They lack
              a mantle cavity. Some species have venomous appendages (cerata) on
              their sides, which deter predators. Many also have a simple gut
              and a mouth with a radula.
            </p>

            <p>
              The adult form is without a shell or operculum (in shelled
              gastropods, the operculum is a bony or horny plate that can cover
              the opening of the shell when the body is withdrawn). In most
              species, there is a swimming veliger larva with a coiled shell,
              but the shell is shed at metamorphosis when the larva transforms
              into the adult form. Some species have direct development, and the
              shell is shed before the animal emerges from the egg mass.

            <h2>Defence mechanisms</h2>
            <p>
              In the course of their evolution, nudibranchs have lost their
              shells, while developing alternative defence mechanisms. Some
              species evolved an external anatomy with textures and colours that
              mimicked surrounding sessile invertebrate animals (often their
              prey sponges or soft corals) to avoid predators (camouflage).
              Other nudibranchs, as seen especially well on chromodorids, have
              an intensely bright and contrasting colour pattern that makes them
              especially conspicuous in their surroundings. Nudibranch molluscs
              are the most commonly cited examples of aposematism in marine
              ecosystems, but the evidence for this has been contested,[18]
              mostly because few examples of mimicry are seen among species,
              many species are nocturnal or cryptic, and bright colours at the
              red end of the spectrum are rapidly attenuated as a function of
              water depth. For example, the Spanish dancer nudibranch (genus
              Hexabranchus), among the largest of tropical marine slugs,
              potently chemically defended, and brilliantly red and white, is
              nocturnal and has no known mimics.[19] Other studies of nudibranch
              molluscs have concluded they are aposematically coloured, for
              example, the slugs of the family Phylidiidae from Indo-Pacific
              coral reefs.
