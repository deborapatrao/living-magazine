              Tardigrades, known colloquially as water bears or moss piglets,
              are a phylum of eight-legged segmented micro-animals. They were
              first described by the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim
              Goeze in 1773, who called them kleiner Wasserbär ("little water
              bear"). In 1777, the Italian biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani named
              them Tardigrada, which means "slow steppers".
            </p>

            <p>
              They have been found everywhere in Earth's biosphere, from
              mountaintops to the deep sea and mud volcanoes, and from tropical
              rainforests to the Antarctic. Tardigrades are among the most
              resilient animals known, with individual species able to survive
              extreme conditions — such as exposure to extreme temperatures,
              extreme pressures (both high and low), air deprivation, radiation,
              dehydration, and starvation — that would quickly kill most other
              known forms of life. Tardigrades have survived exposure to outer
              space. There are about 1,300 known species[15] in the phylum
              Tardigrada, a part of the superphylum Ecdysozoa consisting of
              animals that grow by ecdysis such as arthropods and nematodes. The
              earliest known true members of the group are known from Cretaceous
              (145 to 66 million years ago) amber, found in North America, but
              are essentially modern forms, and therefore likely have a
              significantly earlier origin, as they diverged from their closest
              relatives in the Cambrian, over 500 million years ago.

            <h2>Reproduction</h2>
            <p>
              Although some species are parthenogenic, both males and females
              are usually present, although females are frequently larger and
              more common. Both sexes have a single gonad located above the
              intestine. Two ducts run from the testes in males, opening through
              a single pore in front of the anus. In contrast, females have a
              single duct opening either just above the anus or directly into
              the rectum, which forms a cloaca.
            </p>

            <h2>Ecology and life history</h2>

            <p>
              Most tardigrades are phytophagous (plant eaters) or
              bacteriophagous (bacteria eaters), but some are carnivorous to the
              extent that they eat smaller species of tardigrades (e.g.,
              Milnesium tardigradum).
            </p>

            <p>
              Tardigrades share morphological characteristics with many species
              that differ largely by class. Biologists have a difficult time
              finding verification among tardigrade species because of this
              relationship.[clarification needed] These animals are most closely
              related to the early evolution of arthropods. Tardigrade fossils
              go as far back as the Cretaceous period in North America.
              Tardigrades are considered cosmopolitan and can be located in
              regions all over the world. The eggs and cysts of tardigrades are
              so durable that they can be carried great distances on the feet of
              other animals.

            <h2>Physiology</h2>
            <p>
              Scientists have reported tardigrades in hot springs, on top of the
              Himalaya (6,000 m; 20,000 ft, above sea level) to the deep sea
              (−4,000 m; −13,000 ft) and from the polar regions to the equator,
              under layers of solid ice, and in ocean sediments. Many species
              can be found in milder environments such as lakes, ponds, and
              meadows, while others can be found in stone walls and roofs.
              Tardigrades are most common in moist environments, but can stay
              active wherever they can retain at least some moisture.
            </p>

            <p>
              Tardigrades are thought to be able to survive even complete global
              mass extinction events due to astrophysical events, such as
              gamma-ray bursts, or large meteorite impacts. Some of them can
              withstand extremely cold temperatures down to 1 K (−458 °F; −272
              °C) (close to absolute zero), while others can withstand extremely
              hot temperatures up to 420 K (300 °F; 150 °C) for several minutes,
              pressures about six times greater than those found in the deepest
              ocean trenches, ionizing radiation at doses hundreds of times
              higher than the lethal dose for a human, and the vacuum of outer
              space. Tardigrades that live in harsh conditions undergo an annual
              process of cyclomorphosis, allowing for survival in sub-zero
              temperatures.
